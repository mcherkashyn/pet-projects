In this project I use Terraform to automate the deployment of a simple web application on AWS. The deployment is highly available and scalable, meaning that it is able to handle large amounts of traffic without downtime.

Project steps:

1. Writing Terraform config for AWS infrastructure creating, it consists: ec2 instance for running the web application, ELB and postgresql database.

2. Deployment the infranstructure using Terraform CLI to the cloud platform.

3. Testing my deployment: Once the infrastructure is up and running, I can test my web application to make sure it is working correctly.
