In this project I use Terraform to automate the deployment of a simple web application connected to database on AWS.

Project steps:

1. Writing Terraform config for AWS infrastructure creating, it consists: ec2 instance for running the web application and postgresql database. Also, some other configuration files should be created too.

2. Deployment the infranstructure using Terraform CLI to the cloud platform.

3. Testing my deployment: Once the infrastructure is up and running, I can test my web application to make sure it is working correctly.
